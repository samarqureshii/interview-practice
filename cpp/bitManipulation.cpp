//How would you set, clear, and toggle a specific bit in a variable using bitwise operators?

//Given an integer variable a, write two code fragments. The first should set bit 3 of a. The second should clear bit 3 of a. In both cases, the remaining bits should be unmodified.

//Write a C++ program to encode bits in a 32-bit number such that, most significant 16 bits should be reversed but lower 16 bits should be untouched. Then asked to generalize this to any number of bits.

//Count the number of set bits in an integer

//Bit manipulation questions - detect pattern of ones, write masks to insert pattern of ones in a 32 bit integer, swapping adjacent odd and even bits 

//Swapping Big Endian to Little Endian and vice versa

//Write a program to identify Big Endian vs Little Endian

//Bit Manipulation questions -
    //Reverse the bits of an integer
    //Check the parity of a given number
    //Swap bits in a given integer(positions are provided)
